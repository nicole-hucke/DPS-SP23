%%%%% ALIASING %%%%%%%

%% QUESTION 1: Construct a 1.9 Hz sinusoid for a 10 s signal duration (i.e., 19 full cycles). Plot this sinusoid with an initial sample rate of 1000 Hz (i.e., N = 10,000 samples).  What is its Nyquist frequency?

A = 1; % No info on amplitude, so it's assumed
f = 1.9; % frequency in Hz
duration = 10; % duration in seconds
sps = 1000; % sample rate in Hz (sample per second - sps)
N = duration*sps; % number of samples (10,000 in this case)

% display the Nyquist frequency
downsampled_nyquist_frequency = sps/2; % Nyquist frequency is simply half the sampling rate

%% QUESTION 2: Downsample the sinusoid from step 1 by a factor of 50 while keeping the signal duration 10 s. (Hint… you can easily downsample by passing the notation (1:50:end) as indices to your vector. What is the new Nyquist frequency of your sample?  What is the frequency of the plotted signal?

sps2 = sps/50; % downsampled rate in Hz (sample per second - sps)
downsampled_y = y(1:50:end); % select every 50th sample
downsampled_t = t(1:50:end); % correspondingly downsample the time vector

%% QUESTION 3: Downsample the sinusoid from step 1 by a factor of 500 and plot the new data. What is new Nyquist frequency and what is the (aliased) frequency of the plotted signal (should be easy to estimate off of the graph)?

sps3 = sps/500; % sample rate in Hz (sample per second - sps)

%% QUESTION 5: Based upon your findings in 3 and 4 derive an explicit expression for the aliased frequency as a function of Nyquist frequency and original frequency.
disp('To obtain the aliased frequency of the waves, we must apply: 2 * aliased nyquist - original frequency')

aliased_f3 = 2*downsampled3_nyquist_frequency - f;

disp('It applied an anti-aliasing filter to the signal before downsampling. The anti-aliasing filter removes high-frequency components that are beyond the new Nyquist frequency (i.e., half the new sample rate) after downsampling. By removing these high-frequency components, the function helps ensure that the signal after downsampling will not contain any new, false frequencies that are created due to aliasing.')
