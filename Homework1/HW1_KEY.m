%% 1: Produce and plot a 1000 sample 2 Hz sine wave.  Use peak-to-peak amplitude of 2 and DC offset of +2 and sampling of 100 Hz.
A = 1; % means peak-to-peak is 2
DC = 2; % DC offset
sps = 100; % sample rate
f = 2; % frequency cycles per second
omega = f*2*pi; % frequency in radians per second
N = 1000;
t = (1:N)/sps;
x1 = DC + A*sin(t*2*pi*f);

figure(1); clf
plot(t,x1)

%% 2: Numerically calculate the standard deviation of this time series.  Do this without using the built-in MATLAB function std.  Provide the syntax (MATLAB equation) for your standard deviation calculation.  Verify that your result is the same as produced by std.
mu1 = sum(x1)/N;
sigma1 = sqrt((1/(N-1))*sum((x1-mu1).^2))
sigma1_builtin = std(x1) 

%% 3: repeat parts 1 and 2 for a square wave of same frequency amplitude, and offset.  Use function square.
x3 = DC + A*square(t*2*pi*f);
sigma3 = std(x3)

figure(3); clf
plot(t,x3)

xlabel('time (s)')

%% 4: plot uniform random noise (use rand) for the range [1,3] and then calculate its standard deviation. 
x4 = (rand(N,1)-.5)*2*A + DC; % note that rand.m random noise has a range of 0 to 1 so 0.5 is subtracted to center it around 0

%% 5: use hist to plot histograms for the three data series.  For each histogram use 10 bins in the interval from 1 to 3.  I Suggest use of linspace command for bin construction.  You will want to be %cleverâ€™ about constructing the bin center values.
bins = linspace(1.1,2.9,10) % bindwith is 0.2 with domain from 1 to 3
% alternatively (and equivalently
bins = [1.1:.2:2.9]

%% 6: replot the histograms from the previous figures as probability mass functions (i.e. sum of all bins total 100%).
% scale all output from histograms by the population size N; then check to
% see if all probabilities sum to a total of 1

%% 7: replot the histograms from the previous figure as probability density functions (integration must total 1).
% scale all output from histograms by the population size N and bin width (0.2), 
% which equals 0.2; then check to see if all probabilities sum to a total of 1

bin_width = .2; % because there are ten bins in a domain of 2
